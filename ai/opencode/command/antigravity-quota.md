description: Check Antigravity quota status for all configured Google accounts
---

Use the `antigravity_quota` tool to check the current quota status.

This will show:
- API quota remaining for each model (Gemini 3 Pro, Flash, Claude via Antigravity)
- Per-account breakdown with visual progress bars
- Time until quota reset
- Local rate limit cache status

Just call the tool directly:
```
antigravity_quota()
```

IMPORTANT: Display the tool output EXACTLY as it is returned. Do not summarize, reformat, or modify the output in any way.
